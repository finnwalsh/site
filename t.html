	<h1>Alli </h1>
	<h3>Although she was born into the noble Vaughn family, who values blood ties over all else, Alli has not been what one would call “proud.” Instead, she is a kind and gentle soul who treats all around her as equals. Many people consider her to be a mediator and a calming influence.</h3>
