	<h1>Charles</h1>
	<h3>Desperate for a challenge and thirsty for blood, Charles wanders the battlefield looking for foes worthy of his attention. He carries no weapon; his body is enough. More than enough, in factâ€”his strength is so overwhelming that he must consciously hold himself in back in every battle to have even the hint of a challenge.</h3>
