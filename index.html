  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p>
In a time now long past, Griffin faced extinction at the hands of "Charles", a man that appeared out of the darkness. The man was possessed by an awesome power, and it appeared that the time of Griffin would soon be at an end. It was then, in Griffin's darkest hour, that a hero of unknown origin came forward to defeat the foul being. His name was Ian Chambers. He brought with him the ancient power of “Pregunta Oral”, which he freely shared with los estudiantes.

With this newfound power, los estudiantes confronted the wretched being, Ian fighting alongside them. After many long, blood-soaked battles, Charles finally fell, ending what would come to be known as the “First War of Griffin”. Ian was immortalized for his deeds and, through generations, came to be known as “El Capitan”.

Charles was defeated, and los estudiantes breathed a sigh of relief, but their troubles were far from over.

Great flows of crabs began to pour from the corpse of Charles, and before long they covered most of the Earth’s surface. It was quickly discovered that prolonged exposure to crabs, later dubbed “Mini-Charles”, was detrimental to los estudiantes. In an effort to avoid it, what remained of los estudiantes retreated to an area known to few called "Brick Hall".

An organization was formed during the First War named "The Good Scholars". Their primary goal was to regulate the use of the “Milagros”, great weapons of mass destruction brought about by Ian's grace.

Decades have passed since the Good Scholars established themselves as leaders of Brick Hall, and Magic became the deciding factor in nearly all of humanity’s affairs. This has led to a large socioeconomic gap between those who can wield the power of "Pregunta Oral" and those who cannot. Tensions began to flare, and before long a rebel organization calling themselves the “Saucy Boys” appeared, defying the totalitarian authority of the Good Scholars. With the creation of the Saucy Boys, angry thoughts became open hostilities, and the “Second War of Griffin” began.

~A.D.2200 Jan~

Many years have passed since those events.
During that time a branch of the Good Scholars, reputed to command a force as powerful as an entire nation’s army, was suddenly and utterly destroyed by a single man named Jeff, who has been branded a traitor.

Patrick Potulski, who currently has the highest bounty ever offered in recorded history and considered by just about everyone alive as public enemy #1, a merciless killer hell-bent on destroying public order. He traveled to Brick Hall, destroying the sacred relic known as the "Touchstone". After destroying the Touchstone, something seemed to change in him, but despite his change in personality, his true goals and motivations remain a mystery to those around him.

BLAZBLUE: GRIFFINTASMA EXTEND puts a heavy emphasis on story-telling and crafting a deep, complex narrative. We expect these elements to appeal to and draw in comic, manga and Ryan Larrew fans. Story Mode is both open-ended and multi-ending. As such, the player can choose their path and enjoy their own story. </p>
