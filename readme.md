Hello there,

	We are Finn Walsh, Cole Alvarez, and Knox Alvarez. We have made a website advertising a fake game that isn't real (but would be pretty cool if it was). The game is a fighting game that takes place between Griffin teachers, with an intense and deep story behind it (very intense). It took about one month, but with basic coding knowledge we did it. You can also look at some fake reviews, and some fake character descriptions. We hope you enjoy!

	Sincerely,
		Finn and his friends who are not as cool but still okay.
